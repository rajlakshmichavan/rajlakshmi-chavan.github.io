    <h1>Rajlakshmi's portfolio and blog </h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website. 
        I am Rajlakshmi. <br>
        This website is a record of everything I am building, researching, reading and thinking about. <br>
        My main interests include economics, finance, sports, business and literature. <br>
        I am mostly fascinated with understanding how the world works and trying to understand where it is going. <br>
        I'm documenting this journey through a variety of projects ("Projects") and also exploring topics I find fascinating by writing articles about them ("Articles"). </p>
