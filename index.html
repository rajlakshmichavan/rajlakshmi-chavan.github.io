    <h1>Rajlakshmi's portfolio and blog </h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website. I am Rajlakshmi. This website is a record of everything I am building, researching, reading and thinking about. My main interests include economics, finance, sports, business and literature. I am mostly fascinated with understanding how the world works and trying to understand where it is going. I'm documenting this journey through a variety of projects ("Projects") and also writing articles exploring topics I find fascinating ("Articles"). </p>
